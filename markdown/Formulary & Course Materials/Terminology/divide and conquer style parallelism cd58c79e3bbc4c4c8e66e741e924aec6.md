# divide and conquer style parallelism

Description: Also called recursive splitting. Solve a problem in divide and conquer style: solve a larger problem by recursively solving smaller sub-problems and combine their results. Solve the sub-problems in separate threads to gain a speedup. This way, work can be decomposed recursively to small tasks that can be efficiently scheduled on available tasks using e.g. the ForkJoin framework.
