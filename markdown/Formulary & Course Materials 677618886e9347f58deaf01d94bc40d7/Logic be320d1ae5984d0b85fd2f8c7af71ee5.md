# Logic

# Proof Systems

## Definition

In a formal treatment of mathematics, all objects of study must be described in a well-defined syntax. Typically, syntactic objects are finite strings over some alphabet $\Sigma$, for example the symbols allowed by the syntax of a logic or simply the alphabet $\{0, 1\}$, in which case syntactic objects are bit-strings. Recall that $\Sigma^*$ denotes the set of finite strings of symbols from $\Sigma$.

In this section, the two types of mathematical objects we study are

- *mathematical statements* of a certain type and
- *proofs* for this type of statements.

By a statement type we mean for example the class of statements of the form that a given number $n$ is prime, or the class of statements of the form that a given graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle, or the class of statements of the form that a given formula $F$ in propositional logic is satisfiable.

Consider a fixed type of statements. Let $\mathcal{S} \sube \Sigma^*$ be the set of (syntactic representations of) mathematical statements of this type, and let $\mathcal{P} \sube \Sigma^*$ be the set of (syntactic representations of) proof strings.

Every statement $s \in \mathcal{S}$ is either true or false. The *truth function*

$$
\tau : \mathcal{S} \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}
$$

assigns to each $s \in \mathcal{S}$ its truth value $\tau (s)$. This function $\tau$ defines the meaning, called the *semantics*, of objects in $\mathcal{S}$.

An element $p \in \mathcal{P}$ is either a (valid) proof for a statement $s \in \mathcal{S}$, or it is not. This can be defined via a *verification function*

$$
\phi: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{P} \longrightarrow \{0,1\},
$$

where $\phi (s, p)=1$ means that $p$ is a valid proof for statement $s$.

Without strong loss of generality we can in this section consider

$$
\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{P} = \{0,1\}^*,
$$

with the understanding that any string in $\{0, 1\}^*$ can be interpreted as a statement by defining syntactically wrong statements as being false statements.

<aside>
üí° A *proof system* is a quadruple $\Pi = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P}, \tau, \phi)$, as above.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A proof system $\Pi = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P}, \tau, \phi)$ is *sound* if no false statement has a proof, i.e., if for all $s \in \mathcal{S}$ for which there exists $p \in \mathcal{P}$ with $\phi (s, p) = 1$, we have $\tau (s) = 1$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A proof system $\Pi = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P}, \tau, \phi)$ is *complete* if every true statement has a proof, i.e., if for all $s \in \mathcal{S}$ with $\tau (s) = 1$, there exists $p \in \mathcal{P}$ with $\phi(s, p) = 1$.

# Elementary General Concepts in Logic

<aside>
üí° A goal of logic is to provide a specific proof system $\Pi = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P}, \tau, \phi)$ for which a very large class of mathematical statements can be expressed as an element of $\mathcal{S}$.

</aside>

However, such a proof system $\Pi = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P}, \tau, \phi)$ can never capture *all* possible mathematical statements. For example, it usually does not allow to capture (self-referential) statements about $\Pi$, such as ‚Äú$\Pi$ is complete‚Äù, as an element of $\mathcal{S}$. The use of common language is therefore unavoidable in mathematics and logic.

In logic, an element $s \in \mathcal{S}$ consist of one or more formulas (e.g. a formula, or a set of fomrulas, or a set of fomulas and a formula), and a proof consist of applying a certain sequence of syntactic steps, called a *derivation* or a *deduction*. Each step consists of applying one of a set of allowed syntactic rules, and the set of allowed rules is called a *calculus*. A rule generally has some place-holders that must be instantiated by concrete values.

In standard treatments of logic, the syntax of $\mathcal{S}$ and the semantics (the function $\tau$) are carefully defined. In contrast, the function $\phi$, which consists of verifying the correctness of each rule application step, is not completely explicitely defined. One only defines rules, but for example one generally does not define a syntax for expressing how the place-holders of the rules are instantiated.

<aside>
üí° The *syntax* of a logic defines an alphabet $\Lambda$ (of allowed symbols) and specifies which strings in $\Lambda^*$ are formulas (i.e., are syntactically correct).

</aside>

<aside>
üí° The *semantics* of a logic defines (among other things) a function $\text{free}$ which assigns to each formula $F = (f_1, f_2,..., f_k) \in \Lambda^*$ a subset $\text{free}(F) \sube \{1,...,k\}$ of the indices. If $i \in \text{free}(F)$, then the symbol $f_i$ is said to occur *free* in $F$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° An *interpretation* consists of a set $\mathcal{Z} \sube \Lambda$ of symbols of $\Lambda$, a domain (a set of possible values) for each symbol in $\mathcal{Z}$, and a function that assigns to each symbol in $\mathcal{Z}$ a value in its associated domain.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° An interpretation is *suitable* for a formula $F$ if it assigns a value to all symbols $\beta \in \Lambda$ occurring free in $F$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° The *semantics* of a logic also defines a function $\sigma$ assigning to each formula $F$, and each interpretation $\mathcal{A}$ suitable for $F$, a truth value $\sigma (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{A})$ in $\{0, 1\}$. In treatments of logic one often writes $\mathcal{A}(F)$ instead of $\sigma (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{A})$ and calls $\mathcal{A}(F)$ *the truth value of $F$ under interpretation $\mathcal{A}$.*

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A (suitable) interpretation $\mathcal{A}$ for which a formula $F$ is true, (i.e., $\mathcal{A}(F) = 1$) is called a *model* for $F$, and one also writes

$$
\mathcal{A} \vDash F.
$$

More generally, for a set $M$ of formulas, a (suitable) interpretation for which all formulas in $M$ are true is called a model for $M$, denoted as

$$
\mathcal{A} \vDash M.
$$

If $\mathcal{A}$ is not a model for $M$ one writes $\mathcal{A} \space \cancel \vDash \space M$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A formula $F$ (or a set $M$ of formulas) is called *satisfiable* if there exists a model for $F$ (or $M$), and *unsatisfiable* otherwise. The symbol $\bot$ is used for an unsatisfiable formula.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A formula $F$ is called a *tautology* or *valid* if it is true for every suitable interpretation. The symbol $\top$ is used for a tautology.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A formula $G$ is a *logical consequence* of a formula $F$ (or a set $M$ of formulas), denoted

$$
F \vDash G \space (\text{or} \space M \vDash G),
$$

if every interpretation suitable for both $F$ (or $M$) and $G$, which is a model for $F$ (for $M$), is also a model for $G$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° Two formulas $F$ and $G$ are *equivalent*, denoted $F \equiv G$, if every interpretation suitable for both $F$ and $G$ yields the same truth value for $F$ and $G$, i.e., if each one is a logical consequence of the other:

$$
F \equiv G \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{\iff} F \vDash G \space \text{and} \space G \vDash F.
$$

</aside>

<aside>
üí° If $F$ is a tautology, one also writes $\vDash F$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° If $F$ and $G$ are formulas, then also $\neg F, (F \land G)$ and $(F \lor G)$ are formulas.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° $\mathcal{A}((F \land G)) = 1$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}(F) = 1$ and $\mathcal{A}(G) = 1$.
$\mathcal{A}((F \lor G)) = 1$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}(F) = 1$ or $\mathcal{A}(G) = 1$.
$\mathcal{A}(\neg F) = 1$          if and only if $\mathcal{A}(F) = 0$

6. $*F \lor (G \land H) \equiv (F \lor G) \land (F \lor H)$ (distributive law)*
7. $\neg\neg F \equiv F$ *(double negation)*
8. $*\neg (F \land G) \equiv \neg F \lor \neg G$ and $\neg (F \lor G) \equiv \neg F \land \neg G$ (de Morgan‚Äôs rules)*
9. $*F \lor \top \equiv \top$ and $F \land T \equiv F$ (tautology rules)*
10. $*F \lor \bot \equiv F$ and $F \land \bot \equiv \bot$ (unsatisfiability rules)*

# Logical Calculi

<aside>
üí° A *derivation rule* is a rule for deriving a formula from a set of formulas (called the precondition). We write

$$
\{F_1, ..., F_k\} \vdash_R G
$$

if G can be derived from the set $\{F_1, ..., F_k\}$ by rule $R$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° (Informal.) The *application of a derivation rule* $R$ to a set $M$ of formulas means

1. Select a subset $N$ of $M$.
2. For the place-holders in $R$: specify formulas that appear in $N$ such that $N \vdash _R G$ for a formula $G$.
3. Add $G$ to the set $M$ (i.e., replace $M$ by $M \cup \{G\}$).
</aside>

<aside>
üí° A (logical) *calculus $K$* is a finite set of derivation rules: $K = \{R_1,...,R_m\}$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A *derivation* of a formula $G$ from a set $M$ of formulas in a calculus $K$ is a finite sequence (of some length $n$) of applications of rules in $K$, leading to $G$. More precisely, we have

- $M_0 := M$
- $M_i := M_{i - 1} \cup \{G_i\}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$, where $N \vdash_{R_i} G_i$ for some $N \sube M_{i - 1}$ and for some $R_j \in K$, and where
- $G_n = G$

We write

$$
M \vdash_K G
$$

if there is a derivation of $G$ from $M$ in the calculus $K$.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A derivation rule $R$ is *correct* if for every set $M$ of formulas and every formula $F$, $M \vdash_R F$ implies $M \vDash F$:

$$
M \vdash _R F \implies M \vDash F.
$$

</aside>

<aside>
üí° A calculus $K$ is *sound* or *correct* if for every set $M$ of formulas and every formula $F$, if $F$ can be derived from $M$ then $F$ is also a logical consequence of $M$:

$$
M \vdash _K F \implies M \vDash F,
$$

and $K$ is *complete* if for every $M$ and $F$, if $F$ is a logical consequence of $M$, then $F$ can also be derived from $M$:

$$
M \vDash F \implies M \vdash_K F.
$$

A calculus $K$ is hence sound and complete if

$$
M \vdash_K F \iff M \vDash F
$$

i.e., if logical consequence and derivability are identical. Clearly, a calculus is sound if and only if every derivation rule is correct. One writes $\vdash_K F$ if $F$ can be derived in $K$ from the empty set of formulas. Note that if $\vdash_K F$ for a sound calculus, then $\vDash F$, i.e., $F$ is a tautology.

</aside>

<aside>
üìå *If $\{F_1, ..., F_k\} \vdash_K G$ holds for a sound calculus, then*

# Propositional Logic

<aside>
üí° (Syntax.) An *atomic formula* is of the form $A_i$ with $i \in \mathbb{N}$. A *formula* is defined as follows:

- An atomic fomula is a formula.
- If $F$ and $G$ are formulas, then also $\neg F, (F \land G)$ and $(F \lor G)$ are formulas.
</aside>

<aside>
üí° (Semantics.) For a set $Z$ of atomic formulas, an interpretation $\mathcal{A}$, called *truth assignment*, is a function $\mathcal{A} : Z \longrightarrow \{0,1\}$. A truth assignment $\mathcal{A}$ is suitable for a formula $F$ if $Z$ contains all atomic formulas appearing in $F$. The semantics (i.e., the truth value $\mathcal{A}(F)$ of a formula $F$ under interpretation $\mathcal{A}$) is defined by $\mathcal{A}(F) = \mathcal{A}(A_i)$ for any atomic formula $F = A_i$,

# Predicate Logic (First-order Logic)

<aside>
üí° (Syntax of predicate logic.)

- A *variable symbol* is of the form $x_i$ with $i \in \mathbb{N}$.
- A *function symbol* is of the form $f_i^{(k)}$ with $i, k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $k$ denotes the number of arguments of the function. Function symbols for $k = 0$ are called *constants*.
- A *predicate symbol* is of the form $P_i^{(k)}$ with $i, k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $k$ denotes the number of arguments of the predicate.
- A *term* is defined inductively: A variable is a term, and if $t_1, ..., t_k$ are terms, then $f_i^{(k)} (t_1,...,t_k)$ is a term. For $k = 0$ one writes no parentheses.
- A *formula* is defined inductively:
    - For any $i$ and $k$, if $t_1,...,t_k$ are terms, then $P_i^{(k)}(t_1,...,t_k)$ is a formula, called an *atomic* formula
    - If $F$ and $G$ are formulas, then $\neg F$, $(F \land G)$, and $(F \lor G)$ are formulas.
    - If $F$ is a formula, then, for any $i$, $\forall x_i \space F$ and $\exists x_i \space F$ are formulas.
</aside>

<aside>
üí° Every occurrence of a variable in a formula is either *bound* or *free*. If a variable $x$ occurs in a (sub-) formula of the form $\forall x \space G$ or $\exists x \space G$, then it is bound, otherwise it is free. A formula is *closed* if it contains no free variables.

</aside>

üí° An *interpretation* or *structure* is a tuple $\mathcal{A} = (U, \phi, \psi, \xi)$ where

- $U$ is a non-empty set, the so-called *universe*

- $\psi$ is a function assigning to each predicate symbol (in a certain subset of all predicate symbols) a function, where for a $k$-ary predicate symbol $P$, $\psi(P)$ is a function $U^k \longrightarrow \{0,1\}$

<aside>
üí° (Semantics.) For an interpretation (structure) $\mathcal{A} = (U, \phi, \psi, \xi)$, we define the value (in $U$) of terms and the truth value of formulas under that structure.

- The value $\mathcal{A}(t)$ of a term $t$ is defined recursively as follows:
    - If $t$ is a variable, i.e., $t = x_i$, then $\mathcal{A}(t) = \xi (x_i)$.
    - If $t$ is of the form $f(t_1, ..., t_k)$ for terms $t_1,...,t_k$ and a $k$-ary function symbol $f$, then $\mathcal{A}(t) = \phi(f)(\mathcal{A}(t_1),...,\mathcal{A}(t_k))$.
- The truth value of a formula $F$ is defined recursively by

and

- If $F$ is of the form $F = P(t_1,...,t_k)$ for terms $t_1,...,t_k$ and a $k$-ary predicate symbol $P$, then $\mathcal{A}(F) = \psi(P)(\mathcal{A}(t_1),...,\mathcal{A}(t_k))$.
- If $F$ is of the form $\forall x \space G$ or $\exists x \space G$, then let $\mathcal{A}_{[x \to u]}$ for $u \in U$ be the same structure as $\mathcal{A}$ except that $\xi (x)$ is overwritten by $u$ (i.e., $\xi (x) = u$):

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{A}(\forall x \space G) & = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $\mathcal{A}_{[x \to u]}(G) = 1$ for all $u \in U$}\\
      0 & \text{else}
