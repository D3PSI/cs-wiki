# Hardware Description Languages

# Introduction

Thus far we have focused on designing combinational and sequential digital circuits at the schematic level. The process of finding an efficient set of logic gates to perform a given function is labor intensive and error prone, requiring manual simplification of truth tables or Boolean equations and manual translation of finite state machines (FSMs) into gates. In the 1990â€™s, designers discovered that they were far more productive if they worked at a higher level of abstraction, specifying just the logical function and allowing a *computer-aided design (CAD)* tool to produce the optimized gates. The specifications are generally given in a *hardware description language (HDL)*. The two leading hardware description languages are *Verilog* and *VHDL*. We will focus on Verilog only.

## Modules

A block of hardware with inputs and outputs is called a *module*. An $\text{AND}$ gate, a multiplexer, and a priority circuit are all examples of hardware modules. The two general styles for describing module functionality are *behavioral* and *structural*. Behavioral models describe what a module does. Structural models describe how a module is built from simpler pieces; it is an application of hierarchy. The Verilog code in the example illustrates behavioral descriptions of a module that computes the Boolean function $Y = \bar{A}\bar{B}\bar{C}+A\bar{B}\bar{C}+A\bar{B}C$. The module is named `sillyfunction` and has three inputs `a`, `b` and `c`, and one output, `y`.

A Verilog module begins with the module name and a listing of the inputs and outputs. The `assign` statement describes combinational logic. `~` indicates $\text{NOT}$, `&` indicates $\text{AND}$ and `|` indicates $\text{OR}$.

Verilog signals such as the inputs and outputs are Boolean variables. They may also have floating and undefined values. 

```verilog
module sillyfunction (input a, b, c, 
											output y);
	assign y = ~a & ~b & ~c |
							a & ~b & ~c |
							a & ~b &  c;
endmodule
```

A module is a good application of modularity. It has a well defined interface, consisting of its inputs and outputs, and it performs a specific function. The particular way in which it is coded is unimportant to others that might use the module, as long as it performs its function.
