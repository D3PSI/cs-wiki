# CISC, RISC

Description: CISC (complex instruction set computer) and RISC (reduced instruction set computer) are two fundamental CPU architecture models. Classical RISC is easier to study, since simpler: e.g. RISC instructions can only work on registers, and reading/writing memory are separate instructions.
