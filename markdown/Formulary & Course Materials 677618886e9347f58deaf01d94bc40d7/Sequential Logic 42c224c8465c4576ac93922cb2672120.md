# Sequential Logic

# Introduction

The outputs of *sequential* logic depend on both current and prior input values. Hence, sequential logic has memory. Sequential logic might explicitly remember certain previous inputs, or it might distill the prior inputs into a smaller amount of information called the *state* of the system. The state of a digital sequential circuit is a set of bits called *state variables* that contain all the information about the past necessary to explain the future behavior of the circuit.

The fundamental building block of memory is a *bistable* element, an element with two stable states. The figure shows a simple bistable element consisting of a pair of inverters connected in a loop. The same circuit is redrawn to emphasize the symmetry. The inverters are *cross-coupled*, meaning that the input of I1 is the output of I2 and vice versa. The circuit has no inputs, but it does have two outputs, $Q$ and $\bar{Q}$. Analyzing this circuit is different from analyzing a combinational circuit because it is cyclic: $Q$ depends on $\bar{Q}$, and $\bar{Q}$ depends on $Q$.

Consider the two cases, $Q$ is 0 or $Q$ is 1. For each case the following consequences result:

- Case 1: $Q = 0$
    
    As shown in figure a), I2 receives a FALSE input, $Q$, so it produces a TRUE output on $\bar{Q}$. I1 receives a TRUE input, $\bar{Q}$, so it produces a FALSE output on $Q$. This is consistent with the original assumption that $Q = 0$, so the case is said to be *stable*.
    
- Case 2: $Q = 1$
    
    As shown in figure b), I2 receives a TRUE input and produces a FALSE output on $\bar{Q}$. I1 receives a FALSE input and produces a TRUE output on $Q$. This is again stable.

Because the cross-coupled inverters have two stable states, $Q = 0$ and $Q = 1$, the circuit is said to be bistable. A subtle point is that the circuit has a third possible state with both outputs approximately halfway between 0 and 1. This is called a *metastable state* and will be discussed later.

An element with $N$ stable states conveys $\log_2 N$ bits of information, so a bistable element stores one bit. The state of the cross-coupled inverters is contained in one binary state variable, $Q$. The value of $Q$ tells us everything about the past that is necessary to explain the future behavior of the circuit. Specifically, if $Q = 0$, it will remain 0 forever, and if $Q = 1$, it will remain 1 forever. The circuit does have another node, $\bar{Q}$, but $\bar{Q}$ does not contain any additional information because if $Q$ is known, then $\bar{Q}$ is also known. On the other hand, $\bar{Q}$ is also an acceptable choice for the state variable.

When power is first applied to a sequential circuit, the initial state is unknown and usually unpredictable. it may differ each time the circuit is turned on.

Although the cross-coupled inverters can store a bit of information, they are not practical because the user has no inputs to control the state. However, other bistable elements, such as *latches* and *flip-flops*, provide inputs to control the value of the state variable.
