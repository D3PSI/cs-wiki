# Flows

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A *network* is a tuple $N = (V,A,c,s,t)$, where the following hold:

1. $(V,A)$ is a directed graph,
2. $s\in V$ is the *source*,
3. $t \in V \setminus \{s\}$ is the *target* and,
4. $c : A \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^+_0$ is the *capacity function*.
</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Let $N = (V,A,c,s,t)$ be a network. A *flow* in $N$ is a function $f: A \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with the conditions

1. $0 \leq f(e) \leq c(e)$ for all $e \in A$, the *admissibility*, and
2. for all $v \in V \setminus \{s,t\}$ it holds that 
    
    $$
    \sum_{u\in V: (u,v) \in A}f(u,v) = \sum_{u\in V: (v,u)\in A}f(v,u)
    $$
    
    which is called the *flow conservation*.
    

The *value* of a flow $f$ is defined by 

$$
\text{val}(f) = \text{netoutflow}(s) = \sum_{u \in V: (s,u)\in A}f(s,u) - \sum_{u \in V: (u,s)\in A}f(u,s).
$$

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ *The net inflow of the target equals the value of the flow, i.e.,*

$$
\text{netinflow}(t)=\sum_{u\in V:(u,t) \in A}f(u,t) - \sum_{u \in V:(t,u) \in A}f(t,u) = \text{val}(f).
$$

# Cuts

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ An $s$-$t$-*cut* for a network $(V,A,c,s,t)$ is a partition $(S,T)$ of $V$ (i.e., $S \cup T = V$ and $S \cap T = \varnothing$) with $s \in S$ and $t \in T$. The *capacity* of an $s$-$t$-cut $(S,T)$ is defined by

$$
\text{cap}(S,T) = \sum_{(u,w)\in(S \times T) \cap A} c(u,w).
$$

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ *Let $f$ be a flow and $(S,T)$ be an $s$-$t$-cut in a network $(V,A,c,s,t)$. It then holds that*

$$
\text{val}(f) \leq \text{cap}(S,T).
$$

ðŸ“– (Max-Flow-Min-Cut Theorem).

*Every network $N = (V,A,c,s,t)$ fulfills* 

$$
\max_{f \space \text{flow in $N$}} \text{val}(f) = \min_{(S,T) \space \text{$s$-$t$-cut in $N$}} \text{cap}(S,T).

# Augmenting paths

The fundamental concept behind many max-flow algorithms is to start with an arbitrary flow (e.g., $f$ constant $0$ is good for basically all cases) and improving it successively. A first approach to this could look as follows. Assume we find a directed path $P$ from source to target, where the flow on all edges has not maxxed-out the capacity of the edge, i.e.
