# Divisors and Division


💡 For integers $a$ and $b$ we say that $a$ *divides* $b$, denoted $a \space | \space b$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b = ac$. In this case, $a$ is called a *divisor* of $b$, and $b$ is called a *multiple* of $a$. If $a \neq 0$ and a divisor $c$ exists it is called the *quotient* when $b$ is divided by $a$, and we write $c = \frac{b}{a}$ or $c = b / a$. We write $a \space \nmid \space b$ if $a$ does not divide $b$.




📖 *Euclid’s Theorem:
For all integers $a$ and $d \neq 0$ there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying*

$$
a = dq + r \space \text{and} \space 0 \leq r \lt \lvert d \rvert.
$$

Hence $a$ is called the *dividend*, $d$ is called the *divisor*, $q$ is called the *quotient*, and $r$ is called the *remainder*. The remainder $r$ is often denoted as $R_d(a)$ or sometimes as $a \space \text{mod} \space d$.




💡 For integers $a$ and $b$ (not both 0), an integer $d$ is called a *greatest common divisor* of $a$ and $b$ if $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$ and if every common divisor of $a$ and $b$ divides $d$, i.e., if

$$
d \space | \space a \land d \space | \space b \land \forall c \space ((c \space | \space a \land c \space | \space b) \rightarrow c \space | \space d).
$$




💡 For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ (not both 0) one denotes the unique positive greatest common divisor by $\text{gcd}(a, b)$ and usually calls it *the* greatest common divisor. If $\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1$, then $a$ and $b$ are called *relatively prime*.




📌 *For any integers $m$, $n$ and $q$, we have*

$$
\text{gcd}(m, n - qm) = \text{gcd}(m, n).
$$




💡 The above lemma implies in particular that

$$
\text{gcd}(m, R_m(n)) = \text{gcd}(m,n)
$$

which is the basis for Euclid’s well-known $\text{gcd}$-algorithm: Start with $m \lt n$ and repeatedly replace the pair $(m,n)$ by the pair $(R_m(n), m)$ until the remainder is 0, at which point the last non-zero number is equal to $\text{gcd}(m,n)$.




💡 For $a, b\in \mathbb{Z}$, the *ideal generated by $a$ and $b$*, denoted by $(a, b)$, is the set

$$
(a, b) := \{ua+vb \space | \space u,v \in \mathbb{Z} \}.
$$

Similarly, the ideal generated by a single integer $a$ is

$$
(a) := \{ua \space | \space u \in \mathbb{Z}\}.
$$




📌  *For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ there exists $d \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(a, b) = (d)$.*




📌 *Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ (not both 0). If $(a, b) = (d)$, then $d$ is a greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.*




📎 *For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ (not both 0), there exist $u, v \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that*

$$
\text{gcd}(a, b) = ua + vb.
$$




💡 The *least common multiple* $l$ of two positive integers $a$ and $b$, denoted $l = \text{lcm}(a, b)$, is the common multiple of $a$ and $b$ which divides every common multiple of $a$ and $b$, i.e.,

$$
a \space | \space l \land b \space | \space l \land \forall m \space ((a \space | \space m \land b \space | \space m) \rightarrow l \space | \space m).
$$



# Factorization into Primes


💡 A positive integer $p \gt 1$ is called *prime* if the only positive divisors of $p$ are 1 and $p$. An integer greater than 1 that is not a prime is called *composite*.




📖 *The fundamental theorem of arithmetic:
Every positive integer can be writter uniquely (up to the order in which factors are listed) as the product of primes.*




📌 *If $p$ is a prime which divides the product $x_1x_2...x_n$ of some integers $x_1,...,x_n$, then $p$ divides one of them, i.e., $p \space | \space x_i$ for some $i \in \{1,..., n\}$.*




💡 Expressing $\text{gcd}$ and $\text{lcm}$:
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic assures that integers $a$ and $b$ can be written as

$$
a = \prod_i p_i^{e_i} \space \text{and} \space b = \prod_i p_i^{f_i}.
$$

This product can be understood in two different ways. Either it is over all primes where all but finitely many of the $e_i$ are 0, or it is over a fixed agreed set of primes. Either view is correct. Now we have

$$
\text{gcd}(a, b) = \prod_i p_i^{\text{min}(e_i, f_i)}
$$

and

$$
\text{lcm}(a, b) = \prod_i p_i^{\text{max}(e_i, f_i)}.
$$

It is easy to see that

$$
\text{gcd}(a, b) \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) = ab
$$

because for all $i$ we have

$$
\text{min}(e_i, f_i) + \text{max}(e_i, f_i) = e_i + f_i.
$$




📖 $*\sqrt{n}$ is irrational unless $n$ is a square ($n = c^2$ for some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$).*



# Some Basic Facts About Primes


📖 *There are infinitely many primes.*




📖 *Gaps between primes can be arbitrarily large, i.e., for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the set $\{n, n + 1, ..., n + k - 1\}$ contains no prime.*




💡 The *prime counting function* $\pi : \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is defined as follows: For any real $x$, $\pi (x)$ is the number of primes $\leq x$.




📖 $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{\pi(x)\ln(x)}{x} = 1$.




❓ Conjecture:
There exist infinitely many twin primes, i.e., primes $p$ for which also $p + 2$ is prime.




❓ Goldbach’s Conjecture:
Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.




📌 *Every composite integer $n$ has a prime divisor $\leq \sqrt{n}$.*



# Congruences and Modular Arithmetic


💡 For $a, b, m \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $m \geq 1$, we say that $a$ *is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$* if $m$ divides  $a - b$. We write $a \equiv b \space (\text{mod} \space m)$ or simply $a \equiv_m b$, i.e.,

$$
a \equiv_m b \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{\iff} m \space | \space (a - b).
$$




📌 *For any $m \geq 1$, $\equiv_m$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$.*




💡 $a \space \cancel \equiv_m \space b \implies a \neq b.$




📌 *If $a \equiv_m b$ and $c \equiv_m d$, then*

$$
a + c \equiv_m b + d \space \text{and} \space ac \equiv_m bd.
$$




📎 *Let $f(x_1,...,x_k)$ be a multi-variate polynomial in $k$ variables with integer coefficients, and let $m \geq 1$. If $a_i \equiv_m b_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$, then*

$$
f(a_1, ..., a_k) \equiv_m f(b_1, ..., b_k).
$$




📌 *For any $a, b, m \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $m \geq 1$,*

1. $a \equiv_m R_m(a).$
2. $a \equiv_m b \iff R_m(a) = R_m(b).$



📎 *Let $f(x_1,..., x_k)$ be a multi-variate polynomial in $k$ variables with integer coefficients, and let $m \geq 1$. Then*

$$
R_m(f(a_1, ..., a_k)) = R_m(f(R_m(a_1), ..., R_m(a_k))).
$$




📌 *The congruence equation*

$$
ax \equiv_m 1
$$

*has a solution $x \in \mathbb{Z}_m$ if and only if $\text{gcd}(a, m) = 1$. The solution is unique.*




💡 If $\text{gcd}(a, m) = 1$, the unique solution $x \in \mathbb{Z}_m$ to the congruence equation $ax \equiv_m 1$ is called the *multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $m$*. One also uses the notation $x \equiv_m a^{-1}$ or $x \equiv_m 1 / a$.




📖 *The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):
Let $m_1, m_2,...,m_r$ be pairwise relatively prime integers and let $M = \prod_{i = 1}^{r} m_i$. For every list $a_1,...,a_r$ with $0 \leq a_i \leq m_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq r$, the system of congruence equations*

$$
x \equiv_{m_1} a_1 \\
x \equiv_{m_2} a_2 \\
... \\
x \equiv_{m_r} a_r
$$

for $x$ has a unique solution $x$ satisfying $0 \leq x \le M$.




💡 Useful theorems involving modular arithmetic:

- For any $a,e,m,n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus\{0\}$: $R_m(a^e) = 1 \implies R_m(a^n) = R_m(a^{R_e(n)})$.
